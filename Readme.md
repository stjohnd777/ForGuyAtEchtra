### Echtra
- One week Please turn it in before the week is out.
- Four hours Work on it for only four hours.
- Set a clock, sit down, and do your best.
- Source code
- We are going to compile, run it and test it.
- It will get scrutinized to understand your style, strengths, and flaws as an engineer. 

- Game features
- The game can be launched from the command line.
- Board state can be displayed in ASCII:
```
O | X | O
X |   | 
O | X |  
```
- The player takes a turn first, and then the computer takes a turn.
- The computer should play intelligently.
- The game should recognize when someone has won: End the game
- Display who won
Have fun!


### Well Time is Up

I have many thoughts about the exercise. 
- I was going to write tests but time did not permit.
- Other interesting type of game like larger boards and, higher dimensions, and other topologies.

#### This code was originally designed to be extended hence the FunctionalPlayerclass and the Object.
- Objects
    - Board
    - Payer
        - HumanPlayerConsole
        - RandomComputerPlayer
        - FunctionalPlayer
            - The Never lose Computer
    - Game

- I do know about the min max game theory algorithm.

    - But since I have only 4 hours to work I did not code it. Cutting and pasting code for the internet in such
was not on my Radar. So I coded a do not loose algorithm in a functional Hack. 

##### Also there is allot of potential for folly in this exercise, for example range checking, user input checking and the rest. I did a minimal job here.
